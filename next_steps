Try loading html loader!


-------------------- Player.js ----------------------

Moving function 
- left and bottom seem buggy, moves forward despite block
- right and top seem fine





Load player details from JSON file
steps:
- load json file into cache? 
	- where? BootScene to load into cache and JsonLevelScene to retrieve it (cache.get)
- load name in map - send from bootscene to jsonlevelscene player_details => console.log(this.player_details.party_data[currentPlayer].name)
- load sprite sheet in player.js
 



-------------------- FishingGround.js ----------------------

- Move createobject somewhere else, preferably loadmap








-------------------- HELPERS ----------------------





Using Html loader - only thing that changes is the first loading into cache. It still 
uses level files, etc. to load things into the world as needed in the level! Not much needs 
to be changed!

Export map into map building function
